# Changing the Dark Forest Universe

After every change you make, run `yarn` and `yarn start` in the root `darkforest-local` directory.

### Change the `eth/darkforest.toml` file

The `darkforest.toml` file contains a number of game settings.
1. set `DISABLE_ZK_CHECKS = true`. This will make hashing and confirming moves much faster
